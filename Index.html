<p class="ingress"> The European Project Semester (EPS) is an international programme consisting of 30 ECTS credits – 20 ECTS Project Work and 10 ECTS Supporting Courses.</p>
<p>  European Project Semester (EPS) is a one-semester programme designed to train mainly third year engineering and technology students to carry out project work in international teams. The value of working in an international environment and at the same time improving your English language skills cannot be overestimated in today’s global economy.</p>

<h2> typical student projects at oslomet</h2>
<p> This programme is designed for third year engineering and technology students. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the project, students with other educational background may also apply (e.g. Industrial Design Engineering, Architecture, International Marketing, Business and Administration).</p>

            <h2> Qoutes from students </h2>
            <p> EPS is a program with a lot of room for your own input and lots of time to work on the project and less classes</p>
            <p> Interdisciplinary, fun, project based working with a lot of spare time to travel!</p>
            <p> I learned a lot of soft skills and I developed as a person with that.</p>
            <p> The European Project Semester at OsloMet thaught me more about successful of collaboration and trans-disciplinary development in 6 months, than 3 years of of theoretical studies. Project driven education throws you into an ocean of the unknown and countless opportunities, and teaches helps you to find your own path. </p>
            <p> EPS is a great opportunity for students to be involved in a project oriented learning structure with students from around the globe. Highly recommend for anyone looking to broaden there perspectives.</p>
